  <h2>The Architect</h2>
  <p>The Architect is a passion project that consists of music, illustration and story telling. I challenged myself to write a short story that's told over the length of a track. It was fun experimenting with this idea and I would love to do more. A full 'story album' excites me a lot. The project was split into 3 main parts. The track itself, the cover artwork and a simple music video.</p>
  <h2>The Final Product</h2>

  <p>This project started because of a short drumloop I created. <a href="darkart.html">My first synthwave album</a> has very basic drums, so one day I set out to create a drum pattern that was a little more complex. I came up with the clip below. To me, it sounds like a factory or machinery. The drumloop made me visualize a machine building parts of a robot/cyborg...and that's where the idea of Kane came from.</p>

  <h2>The Cover</h2>
  <p>The single cover artwork itself was inspired by the artwork of Dan Malone and Mark Coleman of the mighty Bitmap Brothers. Their gritty future art style captivated me as a kid and I still love it to this day (Speedball 2, The Chaos Engine, Xenon). I created the elements in Illustrator, then took them into Photoshop for texturing and lighting. From the beginning, I knew I wanted to animate this cover (which was done in After Effects). In this digital age, animated album covers should now be a thing! Of course, only the static cover was used in digital music stores.</p>

  <h2>The Music</h2>
  <p>The track itself was composed in MixCraft, using a number of VST synth plugins. It took a long time to develop the track. I was going back and forth with different ideas, but something seemed to be missing. Eventually, I had the idea to add some voice overs on the track. I'd never done any script writing or storytelling before, but I gave it a go! I hired some voice actors to perfrom my short script and then rebuilt the track around the script. It made a huge improvement and the track sounds a lot different to my usual synthwave style.</p>
  <p>I love how my one short drum loop developed into this character, story and potential universe. I want to take Kane Kinetic further. There's the possibility of doing a full album in this style. I also really like the idea of pursuing a Sega Megadrive game based on the character (using <a href="https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK" target="_blank">SGDK</a>). This is certainly not the last we'll see of Kane Kinetic. Here's a look at some of the graphics I created throughout the project.</p>
