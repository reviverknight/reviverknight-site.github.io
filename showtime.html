  <h2>Pennywise (It)</h2>
  <p>You could argue that this doesn’t belong here because it originated from a book, but it’s my series so who cares?! I love the book, but I didn’t particularly think the first movie adaption was anything special. I'm a big fan of the latest adaption. Pennywise looks terrifying, yet cool as hell. The cast were fantastic and it’s the first time I laughed out loud in a horror film ("They're gazebo's!"). The morning after seeing the film I made this. I thought it would be cool to make an animated GIF too, the blinking eyes freak me out.</p>

  <h2>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</h2>
  <p>The original series of the Power Rangers is fantastic. I used to watch this before school and over my Nan’s house during the school holidays. I also remember playing this in the school yard with my friends, I always wanted to be the Green Ranger. Even though Tommy and Dragonzord were my favourite, I still thought Megazord was awesome and loved how the other zords combined to make it. I love the Power Rangers because it has super heroes, aliens, monsters, “dinosaur robots”, special powers and an awesome theme tune!</p>

  <h2>Knightmare</h2>
  <p>Knightmare was a British children’s adventure game show. The general format of the show is based on a team of four children – one who takes on the game, and three acting as their guide and advisers – attempting to complete a quest within a fantasy medieval environment, traversing a large dungeon and using their wits to overcome puzzles, obstacles and the unusual characters they meet along the journey.</p>
  <p>The ‘one’ who takes on the quest has to wear the helmet illustrated below, and the team mates would guide them through a virtual reality dungeon created via chroma key and 3D modelling.</p>
  <p>My brother and I used to love watching this after school. My favourite part was when the ‘one’ had to mount a dragon (can’t remember it’s name) and it would fly over a vast landscape. Back then that was mind-blowing.</p>

  <h2>Biker Mice from Mars</h2>
  <p>I used to draw the Biker Mice a lot when I was in school. Trying to draw the bikes from memory was a real challenge! I also remember playing it on the school yard with my friends at break time. I used to have a toy of Throttle. He was fixed to his bike and you had to pull a sort of zip cable through his back wheel. The wheel would then light up and he would then shoot off, brilliant!</p>
